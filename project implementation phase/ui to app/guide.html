        Before donating plasma it is important to:<br>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Drink plenty of water or juice to be fully hydrated</li>
        <li>Notify center personnel if you have had recent surgery</li>
        <li>Notify center personnel if you have obtained a tattoo or piercing within the past 12 months</li>
        <li>Notify center personnel if you are taking medication or are under a doctor's care for any medical condition</li></ul>
        Because the need for plasma is so great, we are looking for committed donors. It is only after two satisfactory health screenings and negative test results within six months that you may receive Qualified Donor status. Until you have met this requirement, your plasma will not be used to manufacture therapies. This is important to help ensure the quality and safety of the therapies that patients need to treat life-threatening diseases.
